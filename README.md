# Python
This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Python programs designed to practice fundamental programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, and number operations.

These programs are useful for understanding core logic-building techniques and strengthening problem-solving skills.

📌 Programs Included
1️⃣ Tax Calculation

Determines the tax percentage based on the given salary input.

Logic:

Salary < 30,000 → 5% tax

30,000 < Salary ≤ 70,000 → 15% tax

Salary > 70,000 → 25% tax

Concepts Used:

if-elif-else conditional statements

User input handling

2️⃣ Even Numbers Between Two Numbers

Prints all even numbers between two user-defined values.

Concepts Used:

Functions

for loop

Modulus operator (%)

Range function

3️⃣ Print Digits of a Number

Displays each digit of a number individually and counts total digits.

Concepts Used:

while loop

Integer division (//)

Modulus operator (%)

4️⃣ Sum of Digits

Calculates the sum of all digits in a given number.

Concepts Used:

Arithmetic operations

Looping constructs

5️⃣ Numbers Divisible by 3 and 5 (1–100)

Prints numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by both 3 and 5.

Concepts Used:

Logical AND operator

Looping

Conditional statements

6️⃣ Positive/Negative Number Checker (Menu Driven)

A menu-driven program that:

Accepts a number

Determines whether it is positive or negative

Allows user to exit

Concepts Used:

Infinite loop (while True)

match-case (Python 3.10+)

Break statement

User interaction
